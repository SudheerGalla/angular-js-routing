    <h1>Dhoni Biography</h1>
    <p>
        Dhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an Indian captain in Tests, ODIs and T20Is,
        and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs. He took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in
        2007 and led the team to its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. In June 2013,
        when India defeated England in the final of the Champions Trophy in England, Dhoni became the first captain to
        win all three ICC limited-overs trophies (World Cup, Champions Trophy and the World Twenty20). After taking up
        the Test captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series wins in New Zealand and the West Indies, and the
        Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013.
        In 2009, Dhoni also led the Indian team to number one position for the first time in the ICC Test rankings.
